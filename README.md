# 💧 Pipeline to Hope: A charity: water Puzzle Game

**Pipeline to Hope** is a browser-based puzzle game where players build water pipelines to deliver clean water to remote villages. Designed as both a **school project** and a **portfolio prototype**, this game draws attention to real-world water access issues through engaging, timed gameplay.

Players must strategically place pipes on a grid to connect a water source to as many villages as possible before time runs out. Each misplaced pipe costs valuable seconds, and water only flows through valid paths — no do-overs, no rotations, just smart planning.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build the longest, most effective pipeline from a single water source to as many villages as possible.

- Pipes cannot be rotated — use what you're given.
- Replacing a pipe adds a time penalty.
- Water will attempt to flow through all valid paths.
- Reach the villages before time runs out to win!
